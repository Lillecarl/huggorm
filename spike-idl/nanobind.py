Declaration -> nanobind C++.

The second backend, and the reason the declaration exists. `emit.py`
reads a `read.Class` and writes three Cython files; this reads the
SAME `read.Class` and writes one C++ function. Neither is the other's
input, and the declaration never learns which one ran.

## Why a targeted emitter works where a general one does not

`cgen` is the only real "C++ AST from Python" library, and it models
DECLARATIONS: `Struct`, `FunctionDeclaration`, `Template`. Its
expressions are strings - `Statement(text: str)`. A nanobind module
body is almost entirely one expression, so cgen hands back structure
for the part we do not need and strings for the part we do.

The way out is not a better C++ library. It is a smaller target.
Across nanopynix's 6,600 hand-written lines, 231 bindings use three
shapes - `.def`, `.def_prop_ro`, `.def_ro` - and not one lambda
captures anything. That is a vocabulary small enough to give every
shape a named builder.

## It emits what is CORRECT, not what was written first

Reproducing a hand-written file is the test, not the goal. Where the
two disagree and this emitter is right, it says so and keeps its own
answer. Three such places so far, each verified rather than assumed:

**`nb::is_operator()` on every comparison.** Without it a failed
overload raises TypeError; with it, nanobind returns NotImplemented
(`src/nb_func.cpp:530`). So `sp == None` currently raises in
nanopynix, which breaks `in`, `==` against None, and any generic code
that compares values of mixed type. Verified against the built
module.

**Ordering, when the declaration asks for it.** `nix::StorePath`
defaults `operator<=>` upstream, so `sorted(paths)` should work.
Nothing in nanopynix binds `__lt__`, so today it cannot.

**A view returns by pointer, not through a lambda.** With
`<nanobind/stl/string_view.h>` the caster copies into a Python str
(`PyUnicode_FromStringAndSize`), which is the same copy a hand-written
`std::string(...)` makes - so the lambda buys nothing and hides the
method behind a closure.

## What it refuses

A shape it cannot derive stops with a reason. The escape hatch is
`@custom`, counted and printed, because a hatch nobody measures
becomes the place the real code lives.
